            <h3>Our Goal</h3>
            <p>Even though programming is becomming paramount in conteporary sceintific work, not everyone has been introduced to the concepts that it involves. We all can write scripts that work, but struggle with doing work that is clear for others. Sometimes we are oblivious to current technologies only because there is nobody around who would introduce us to them.</p>
            <p>Aim of this community is to share knowhow of programming. To teach people who are in the position we once were. To teach good habbits so that we can all benefit from each others work. To share knowledge about current approaches and possibilities that arise with software such as Jupyter or new services such cloud computing.</p>
            <p>We hold courses on programming topics, either online or in person in Prague.</p>
