This seminar will teach you basics of GIT but will happen over the internet. Git is a distributed version control system which is widely used in all software development areas. It allows you to track changes, save and load code in certain positions, safely test new ideas etc.

## What we will do
I will explain you the core idea behind git, then all together we will go through the process of installing git on Linux or Windows machines. We will go through basic steps in git versioning. Staging files, committing files, resetting code to earlier state and pushing and pulling code from the server.

## What to do in advance?
-----------
1. Make a github account at https://github.com/. It's free and you can always delete it afterwards. But you might not want to ;)

2. Check if your microphone is working, headphones and possibly camera is working (through not required). I will be teaching the course over [appear.in](https://appear.in) website. Try to create a channel and test functionality of your Internet connection and stuff.

3. Just be ready. I will talk you through the installation process of git myself.

## Important

Github account is necessary to track what happens with pushes and pulls. Even though there are other git solutions, such as [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.com/) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), GitHub has probably the largest community, offers unlimited repositories to researchers, is fast and with neat functionality we will appreciate later.
