This follow-up will be focused on working with data.frames and doing simple statistics, subsetting, plotting and more.

## What we will do

We will do a lot of subsetting and lots of statistical tests on Your data or on movie rating data. That will include manipulating columns, recoding etc.

You will need your own PC with wi-fi module and eduroam access or other internet access that NTK provides.

## What to do in advance?
-----------
Go through past course notebooks at [Github](https://github.com/lab-code/R-for-non-programmers/blob/master/Notebooks)

1. If you want to use some of your simple data, bring your own data in text form or download something interesting.

2. Really brush up and practice what we [worked on](https://github.com/lab-code/R-for-non-programmers/blob/master/Notebooks/Vectors.ipynb) regarding vectors and subsetting.
