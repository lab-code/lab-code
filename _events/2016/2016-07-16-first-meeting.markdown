Meeting people at the Cafedu to clear up some ideas and expectations about the future direction of our community.

## Summary
People would like to know programming to keep up with current science, to be able to do reproducible research and getting rid of excel.

There are two major groups of focus:

1. Designing experiments

2. Analysing experiments

We decided to start from the programming core and slowly start focusing on what everybody needs and would like to practice. The basic ideas behind programming will include:

- knowing the basic structures of code
  - variables and primitive and complex types (string, integer, array, struct)
  - functions
  - classes
  - flow control - if, switch
  - iteration - while, for

- learn versioning
  - using git
  - using versioning sites - github, bitbucket etc.
  - collaboration

- learn syntax of some programming languages
  Focus will be put probbly on R, Python and Matlab, as these are the most used in scientific community

And later the focus will be put on the scientific part of programming

- reproducible science
  - generating output documents from data
  - sharing and collaborating on code as well as text

Full speed ahead :)
