This session is focused on working with data.frames and going from the start to finish. its aimed at those comfortable with material from R for non programmers II.-data.frames

## What we will do

We will focus on imperfect data.frames . Not every table you will read in will have perfect shape. Sometimes you need to recode variables, recompute vectors, add new variables etc. We will learn new ways of subsetting data based on string values, possibly working with time values as well.  We might touch looping and conditions as well.

## What to do in advance?
-----------
Go through past course notebooks at [Github](https://github.com/lab-code/R-for-non-programmers/blob/master/Notebooks)

1. If you want to use some of your simple data, bring your own data in text form or download something interesting.

2. Really brush up and practice what we [worked on](https://github.com/lab-code/R-for-non-programmers/blob/master/Notebooks/Data-frames.ipynb) regarding data.frames, their structure, subsetting (both rows and columns) and some simple functions (head(), summary() etc.)

## Important

You will need your own PC with wi-fi module and eduroam access or other internet access that NTK provides. I can't stress that enough. there is no free Wi-fi in NTK. You either have to have an NTK account or need access to eduroam. If you are PhD sutdents, you should have euroam account provided by your university.
