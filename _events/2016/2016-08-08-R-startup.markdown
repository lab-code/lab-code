This two to three hour course is aimed at those who have never programmed and never worked with R. We will get into basics of what is a variable and a function and how to do simple preprocessing and statistical analysis of movie data.

What we will do
-----------
We will learn basics of programming in R. What is a variable, function, package etc. How to look at prepared data and how to read in your own data to make interesting analyses and get rid of Excel once and for all.

You will need your own PC with wi-fi module and eduroam access or other internet accesse that NTK is providing. R works on Linux, Windows and Mac OS, possibly with some quirks that we will have to deal with as we go.

What to do in advance?
-----------
Have your notebooks ready to do some R programming. That includes following steps:

1. Download R from <https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/>

2.  Install R and open it. Check if everything is fine by running following commands (just copy paste it one by one to the command line) to check:

    ~~~ r
    install.packages('dplyr') #installs package

    library(dplyr) #loads the package

    head(iris) #inspects head of a dataset that comes with R

    iris %>% filter(Species == "virginica") %>% select(Sepal.Width, Species) #filters dataset

    iris %>% filter(Species == "virginica")  %>% summarise(mean = mean(Sepal.Width), sd = sd(Sepal.Width)) #calculates summary stats on the filtered dataset
    ~~~
3. If you have any trouble running above code, message somebody on [slack](https://lab-code.slack.com) in the #r-help channel

4. Download and install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

5. Check if the above commands run in the RStudio as well.

6. Wait :)
