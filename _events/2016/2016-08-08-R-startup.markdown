This two to three hour course is aimed at those who have never programmed and never worked with R. We will get into basics of what is a variable and a function and how to do simple preprocessing and statistical analysis of movie data.

What we will do

What we did

What to do in advance?
-----------
Have your notebooks ready to do some R programming. That includes following steps
1. Download R from: https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/
2. Install R and open it. Check if everything is fine by running following commands to check:
  1. 1 + 1
  2. install.packgages('dplyr')
  3. library(dplyr)
  4. head(iris)
  5. iris %>% filter(Species == "virginica") %>% select(Sepal.Width, Species)
  6. iris %>% filter(Species == "virginica")  %>% summarise(mean = mean(Sepal.Width), sd = sd(Sepal.Width))
3. If you have any trouble running above code, message somebody on slack in the #r-help channel
4. Download and install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)
5. Check above commands if they run in the studio as well.
