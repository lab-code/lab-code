This two to three hour course is aimed at those who have never programmed and never worked with R. We will get into basics of what is a variable and a function and do simple vector math, sequencing,  randomisation etc.

## What we will do

We will learn basics of programming in R. What is a variable, function, package etc. What variable types we have, how to work with vectors and functions and bunch of other stuff.

You will need your own PC with wi-fi module and eduroam access or other internet access that NTK provides. R works on Linux, Windows and Mac OS, possibly with some quirks that we will have to deal with as we go.

## What to do in advance?
-----------
Have your notebooks ready to do some R programming. That includes following steps:

1. Download R from <https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/>

2.  Install R and open it. Check if everything is fine by running following commands (just copy paste it one by one to the command line) to check:

    ``` r
    install.packages('dplyr') #installs package

    library(dplyr) #loads the package

    head(iris) #inspects head of a dataset that comes with R

    iris %>% filter(Species == "virginica") %>% select(Sepal.Width, Species) #filters dataset

    iris %>% filter(Species == "virginica")  %>% summarise(mean = mean(Sepal.Width), sd = sd(Sepal.Width)) #calculates summary stats on the filtered dataset
    ```
3. If you have any trouble running above code, message somebody on [slack](https://lab-code.slack.com) in the #r-help channel

4. Download and install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

5. Check if the above commands run in the RStudio as well.

6. Wait :)
