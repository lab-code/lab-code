This two to three hour course is aimed at those who have never programmed and never worked with R. We will get into basics of what is a variable and a function and how to do simple preprocessing and statistical analysis of movie data.

What we will do
-----------
We will learn basics of programming in R. What is a variable, function, package etc. How to look at prepared data and how to read in your own data to make interesting analyses and get rid of Excel once and for all.

What to do in advance?
-----------
Have your notebooks ready to do some R programming. That includes following steps

1. Download R from <https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/>

2.  Install R and open it. Check if everything is fine by running following commands to check:

    ~~~ r
    install.packgages('dplyr')

    library(dplyr)

    head(iris)

    iris %>% filter(Species == "virginica") %>% select(Sepal.Width, Species)

    iris %>% filter(Species == "virginica")  %>% summarise(mean = mean(Sepal.Width), sd = sd(Sepal.Width))
    ~~~
3. If you have any trouble running above code, message somebody on [slack](https://lab-code.slack.com) in the #r-help channel

4. Download and install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

5. Check above commands if they run in the studio as well.
